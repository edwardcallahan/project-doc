                <p>Reactive application development becoming mainstream is leading to demands on Operations that are simply not met by yesterday’s software architectures and technologies.</p>
                <p>The demands placed on systems are ruthless nowadays. Starting with global expansion in mobile technology and continuing now with IoT, Operations deals with exponentially greater loads; yet for all their efforts, services provided by airlines, banks, retailers and telecommunications providers are still perceived to be sluggish.</p>
                <p>ConductR is a management tool for Operations to deploy and control Reactive applications running in a cluster. Supplementing existing tools that focus on more traditional, monolithic application architectures, ConductR is built specifically for distributed Reactive applications, reflecting that Operations requires a diﬀerent approach to both the tools and methodologies they use.</p>
                <p>ConductR is designed to run with the Typesafe Reactive Platform and provides a RESTful API to integrate with existing tools (e.g. Amazon EC2, Docker, Puppet, Chef, Ansible and Akka Cluster) to provide immutable, DevOps-friendly deployments.</p>
